## Hands-on #2: Make some edits!

### Instruction:

1.  Put a couple of fun fact about yourself or your research interests on `index.qmd` page
2.  Add a new page called `institution.qmd` and put in a couple of fun fact (normal facts are also OK if there is no fun fact) about your institution.
3.  Adjust the `_quarto.yml` page to include this new page in the navigation

## Hands-on #3: Publishing the website to Quarto Pub

### Instruction:

1.  Create an account at Quarto Pub (<https://quartopub.com/>) - make sure to do this on your default browser.

2.  Go back to your project in RStudio, and type the following command on the **Terminal** tab (not Console!): **`quarto publish quarto-pub`**

3.  If this is your first time publishing the project, you will be required to authorize your account and generate the access token. Follow the instructions in terminal.

4.  Once your site is successfully published, it will appear at `https://your-username.quarto.pub/first-quarto-website`

5.  Go to your Quarto Pub account and explore the available options on what you can do with the site.

You can also publish a single document or presentation with a slightly different command:

`quarto publish quarto-pub document-name.qmd`

Try it with one of the document that we created on session 1/session 2!
