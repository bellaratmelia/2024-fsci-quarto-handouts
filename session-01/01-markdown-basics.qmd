## Introduction

This document is designed to help you practice and familiarize yourself with the basic Markdown syntax used in Quarto documents.

Follow along and try out each example in your own Quarto document.

## Headings

Headings are created using the `#` symbol followed by a space. The number of `#` symbols determines the heading level.

# Level 1 Heading

## Level 2 Heading

### Level 3 Heading

#### Level 4 Heading

## Text Formatting

You can add emphasis to your text using asterisks `*`.

*Italic text* **Bold text** ***Bold and Italic text***

use \` to add `verbatim code`.

## Lists

Follow the example below to create a list of points.

-   unordered list

    -   sub-item 1
    -   sub-item 2
        -   sub-sub-item 1

-   item 2

    continued (tab)

1.  ordered list
2.  item 2
    i)  sub-item 1
        A.  sub-sub-item 1

-   [ ] Task 1
-   [x] Task 2

## Testing the line breaks

Line break **doesn't work** with one single line-break. Try using two spaces at the end of a sentence.\
OR a backslash.\
New paragraph can be created with two line-breaks.

Do you notice the subtle differences?

## Links

You can create links using the following syntax: `[link text](url)`.

## Code

Code blocks are created using triple backticks:

\`\`\`python \# Python code block def greet(name): print(f"Hello, {name}!")
